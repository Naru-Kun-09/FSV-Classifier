# FSV-Classifier
This project presents a deep learning-based image classification model designed to accurately recognize and classify fruits into multiple categories. Using the Fruits-360 dataset, the model leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high performance in computer vision tasks related to food and agriculture.

üìñ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust fruit classifier capable of distinguishing between a wide range of fruit categories based on their images. The dataset consists of thousands of labeled fruit images, which were preprocessed and augmented to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.

The model was built using a Sequential CNN architecture, incorporating convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and dropout layers for regularization. The Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss were used to optimize the learning process. This combination ensures faster convergence and improved accuracy across both training and testing sets.
