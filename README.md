# FSV-Classifier
This project presents a deep learning-based image classification model designed to accurately recognize and classify fruits into multiple categories. Using the Fruits-360 dataset, the model leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high performance in computer vision tasks related to food and agriculture.
